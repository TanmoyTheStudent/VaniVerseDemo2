             <b>3.	Sample Set Creation :</b>A small set of text is created and tested with the annotators to ensure they meet the project’s standards.<br/><br/>
  <b>4.	Recording Sessions :</b> Depending on the project’s needs—whether it’s dialectal speech, expressive speech, or story reading—the recording of the text segments is carried out.<br/><br/>
