           <b>1. Project Guidelines Creation:</b>  We start by crafting a comprehensive guideline to ensure our annotators fully understand the project’s objectives and requirements.<br/><br/>
           <b>2. Audio Segmentation:</b>   The provided audio file is divided into smaller, manageable segments for detailed analysis.<br/><br/>
           <b>3. Non-Verbal Sound Identification:</b> We meticulously identify and mark pauses, noises, coughs, laughter, breathing sounds, humming, and other non-verbal sounds within the audio.<br/><br/>
<b>4. Speaker Identification:</b> For audio with multiple speakers, we identify and label each speaker within the segments.<br/><br/>
<b>5. Native Speaker Transcription:</b> Sample audio segments are given to native speakers of the language. Based on the quality of their transcriptions, they are selected for the project.<br/><br/>
<b>6. Content Analysis:</b> Each segment is thoroughly analyzed for any religious, political, abusive, inappropriate, controversial, or personal content, and marked accordingly.<br/><br/>
<b>7. Two-Step Review:</b> Depending on the project’s requirements, a two-step review process is conducted to ensure accuracy and quality.
